# ForestRoaming-Demo
This project is a demo for my solution about synchronous messaging between native iOS and WebGL application.
This app is about a walk in the forest using data from native iOS:
- Tap: to go straight ahead
- Rotate the phone in different directions: to change the camera angle

Laptop browser version of this app: https://duynk2511.github.io/ForestRoamingWebGL/

# Core
Create a synchronous messaging layer at application layer to achieve no message loss, in-order messages and duplicate-free based on Selective Repeat Protocol.

An interactive visualization of this protocol: https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ph/esm/ecs_kurose_compnetwork_8/cw/content/interactiveanimations/selective-repeat-protocol/index.html (From Computer Networking of Jim Kurose Homepage)
